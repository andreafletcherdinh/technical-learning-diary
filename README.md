# About Learning Technical Diary

Self-study diary of IT techniques of a 3rd-year student of Information Technology University - Ho Chi Minh National University. And my major is Computer Network and Data Communications.

## Introduction  

This repository was created to record my journey of self-study and discovery of knowledge and skills in Information Technology, especially in Computer Networks and Communications.

It acts as a digital diary, where I store notes, practice exercises, small projects, and lessons learned during the process of learning and researching.

## Objectives

* **Knowledge storage:** Record the knowledge I have learned systematically, helping me to review and look up when needed easily.

* **Progress tracking:** It helps me track my learning progress and identify my strengths and areas for improvement.


## Diary Structure

This repository includes folders organized by topic or technology that I am learning. In each folder, you can find:

* **Notes:** Summary of theory, concepts, syntax, and important points. It is written in **Markdown syntax**

* **Practice:** Illustrative examples, and practice exercises to apply knowledge into practice.

* **Lessons learned:** Lessons and experiences I have drawn from my study and work.

*(Note: This repository does not specifically list all the technologies mentioned. The content will be continuously updated according to my study process.)*

## How to work?

When there is any change in the directory or file, it needs to be added immediately, then use the syntax ***git commit -m "(corresponding technology): any changes***

If there are any changes in the README.md file, remember to update the *Last updated* section.

## How to use?

Because this repository is created for private purposes, it is not shared with anyone. If you are someone I trust very much, you will obviously be invited to be a collaborator for this repository, then the usage will be as follows:

- Clone this repo to your local machine using the following command (Note that you need to install the git tool to do this):

```
git clone https://github.com/andreafletcherdinh/technical-learning-diary
```

- If there are any changes in the remote, use the *git pull* command as the following syntax:
```
git pull origin [corresponding branch]
```
