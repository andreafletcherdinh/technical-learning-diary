# About Learning Technical Diary

Self-study diary of IT techniques of a 3rd year student of information technology university

## Introduction  

This repository was created to record my journey of self-study and discovery of knowledge and skills in the field of Information Technology, especially in the field of Computer Networks and Communications.

It acts as a digital diary, where I store notes, practice exercises, small projects, and lessons learned during the process of learning and researching.

## Objectives

* **Knowledge storage:** Record the knowledge I have learned in a systematic way, helping me to easily review and look up when needed.

* **Progress tracking:** Helps me track my learning progress, identify my strengths and areas for improvement.


## Diary Structure

This repository includes folders organized by topic or technology that I am learning. In each folder, you can find:

* **Notes:** Summary of theory, concepts, syntax, and important points. It is written in **Markdown syntax**

* **Practice:** Illustrative examples, practice exercises to apply knowledge into practice.

* **Lessons learned:** Lessons and experiences I have drawn from my study and work.

*(Note: This repository does not specifically list all the technologies mentioned. The content will be continuously updated according to my study process.)*\

## How to work?

When there is any change in the directory or file, it needs to be added immediately, then use the syntax ***git commit -m "(corresponding technology): any changes***

## How to use?

Because this repository is created for private purposes, it is not shared with anyone. If you are someone I trust very much, you will obviously be invited to be a collaborator for this repository, then the usage will be as follows:

- Clone this repo to your local machine using the following command (Note that you need to install git tool to do this):
